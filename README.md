# Making a Playlist Automator

This is a personal project I made for my student government position @ ASUSF Senate. We have a QR code set up around campus for students to scan and enter songs they want to add to some collective playlist. We have this setup with the endgoal of events that utilize this collective playlist. So that we don't have to manually insert every entry into our playlist, I wanted to make a program using the Spotify Web API to **automate** the process.
